## Hi, Welcome Aboard! ðŸ‘‹

In this project, I have fully implemented the requirements of the project that was given to me. I'm going to explain the project and the requirements in detail.

### Project Description
I've used React.js to complete the assesment as it was the most suitable library for the project I think. So, this simple web app is a single page application that displays the parsed json in a table as a list of items with all the details as like the image provided in the project requirements. 

### Used Packages and Libraries
I've used the following packages and libraries to complete the project:
- **React.js**: As the main library to build the project.
- **React-icons**: To use the icons in the project.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To style the project.

### How to Run the Project
To run the project, you need to follow the following steps:
1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Run the following command in the terminal to install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Run the following command to start the project:
```bash
npm start
```
5. Open your browser and go to the following link to see the project:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

if you found any difficulty in running and viewing the project, Here is a link to the live project: [Live Project](https://populartravel.netlify.app/)

### Time Spent
I've spent around 4-5 hours(Approx) in 2 days(not continuously, as it was supposed to be submitted in 5 days) to complete the project. I've spent most of the time on the styling of the project as I wanted to make it look as close as possible to the image provided in the project requirements, as the position is for a frontend developer, and my first priority is how user can see the site.

### Best Practices
I've followed the best practices to build the project. 
1. I've used the components to make the project more readable and maintainable. 
2. I've used the tailwind css to style the project as it's a modern way to style the project and it's easy to use. 
3. I've used the react-icons library to use the icons in the project. 
4. I've used the json data provided in the project requirements to display the data in the table.
5. I've used the react props passing to pass the data from parent to child components as it's a small project and it's not complex to handle props in smaller projects like this one.
6. I've made the project responsive for all devices so that it can be accessed from any device.
7. I've put the project on the netlify to make it live and accessible for everyone.
8. I've used the git version control to keep track of the changes I've made in the project.

### Additional Informations
Also, as you were asking for 2 of my live frontend project links, here they are:
1. https://sbsa-panel.netlify.app - it will require a one time login and the credentials are [user: sbsatestadmin, sbsatestpassword@]
    built with html, css, bootstrap and some other frontend technologies
    github repo: https://github.com/MarufAlAslam/sbsa-dashboard-html-bootstrap

2. https://sensar.netlify.app - it's actually a fullstack project built with MERN (and love), but from here you can check the frontend part. If needed I can provide the backend part as well.
    built with react.js(in frontend), express.js(in backend), mongoDB(database), and node.js(environment)
    github repo: https://github.com/MarufAlAslam/sensar-react-frontend

### Important Files/Folders
- **./src/index.js**: The main file that contains the main structure of the project.
- **./src/assets**: The folder that contains the images and css used in the project.
- **./src/components**: The folder that contains the components used in the project.



### Important Notes
- I've used the json data provided in the project requirements to display the data in the table.
- I've used the icons from the react-icons library.
- I've used the tailwind css to style the project.
- I've used the react props passing to pass the data from parent to child components as it's a small project and it's not complex to handle props in smaller projects like this one.
- Most importantly, it's responsive for all devices.
