## Hi, Welcome Aboard! ðŸ‘‹

In this project, I have fully implemented the requirements of the project that was given to me. I'm going to explain the project and the requirements in detail.

### Project Description
I've used React.js to complete the assesment as it was the most suitable library for the project I think. So, this simple web app is a single page application that displays the parsed json in a table as a list of items with all the details as like the image provided in the project requirements. 

### Used Packages and Libraries
I've used the following packages and libraries to complete the project:
- **React.js**: As the main library to build the project.
- **React-icons**: To use the icons in the project.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To style the project.

### How to Run the Project
To run the project, you need to follow the following steps:
1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Run the following command in the terminal to install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Run the following command to start the project:
```bash
npm start
```
5. Open your browser and go to the following link to see the project:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

### Time Spent
I've spent around 4-5 hours(Approx) in 2 days(not continuously, as it was supposed to be submitted in 5 days) to complete the project. I've spent most of the time on the styling of the project as I wanted to make it look as close as possible to the image provided in the project requirements, as the position is for a frontend developer, and my first priority is how user can see the site.

### Important Files/Folders
- **./src/index.js**: The main file that contains the main structure of the project.
- **./src/assets**: The folder that contains the images and css used in the project.
- **./src/components**: The folder that contains the components used in the project.



### Important Notes
- I've used the json data provided in the project requirements to display the data in the table.
- I've used the icons from the react-icons library.
- I've used the tailwind css to style the project.
- I've used the react props passing to pass the data from parent to child components as it's a small project and it's not complex to handle props in smaller projects like this one.
- Most importantly, it's responsive for all devices.
